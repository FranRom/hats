      <b>The Site, Interface and Protocol &ndash; Explanation and Certain
        Risk Factors</b>
      <p ><span >The Site and Interface </span><span >do not</span><span
      >&nbsp;offer the Protocol, which is a decentralized protocol on the Ethereum Blockchain, and which may
        be accessed independently without use of the Site or the Interface.</span></p>
      <p ><span >These Terms relate solely to the Site and the Interface. Use of the Protocol and any
        activity thereon is subject to the&nbsp;Terms of Use of the Protocol located at
        https://github.com/hats-finance/hats-contracts.</span></p>
      <p ><span >YOUR USE OF THE PROTOCOL IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.</span></p>
      <p ><span >On the Site, you will have the ability via the Interface to access the Protocol.
        More information about the Protocol is available here: https://github.com/hats-finance/hats-contracts.</span></p>
      <p ><span >Decentralized Protocol</span><span >: The Protocol is a decentralized
        smart contract running on the Ethereum blockchain. The Interface provides an Interface to access the protocol in a
        user-friendly manner, however due to its decentralized nature IA does not control the Protocol. By using the
        Interface, you acknowledge and recognize that use of the Protocol and deposit of cryptocurrencies or other digital
        assets in the Protocol is at your own risk and will be subject to the rules encoded within the Protocol, including
        as to when and on what terms any deposited cryptocurrencies or other digital assets may be released to a third
        party, neither of which IA can influence or has any control over.</span></p>
      <p ><span >The Protocol is controlled by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) named Hats
        (the &ldquo;</span><span >Hats DAO</span><span >&rdquo;). The governance mechanism of the
          Hats DAO controls the Protocol and has the authority to authorize any changes to the Protocol. IA has no control
          over the Protocol, and no duty to take any action regarding any transaction engaged in through the functionality
          of the Protocol. IA and its affiliates will not be held liable, and are not liable, for any acts or omissions by
          any third party, nor are we liable, or will we be held liable, for any damage that you may suffer as a result of
          interacting with or using any of the mentioned or unmentioned third parties.</span></p>
      <p id="h.gjdgxs"><span >Staking; Risk Disclosures Relating to the Protocol. </span><span
      >By staking crypto-assets within the Protocol, you will </span><span >be eligible to
        receive certain rewards, as determined by the Protocol. However, by staking crypto-assets in the Protocol you also
        assume the risk that a security vulnerability will be detected in the smart contract associated with the
        applicable pool into which you have staked your crypto-assets, in which case all or part of your crypto-assets
        will be released to the detector of such security vulnerability. By staking any crypto-assets within the protocol,
        you knowingly and voluntarily assume such risk.</span></p>
      <p ><span >Risk Disclosures Relating to Blockchain</span><span >. By utilizing the
        Interface, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems; and warrant
        that you have an understanding of the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens, digital assets, blockchains
        and other distributed and decentralized systems, and smart contracts. In particular, you are aware and recognize
        that any transactions conducted on a blockchain cannot be undone or reversed.</span></p>
      <p ><span >Information</span><span >. The site may contain information regarding
        the Protocol or particular instances of the Protocol. Such information is provided for informational purpose only,
        without any representation or warranty. IA does not assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or
        inaccuracy of any such information. Before acting upon or making any decisions on the basis of such information,
        you are responsible to independently verify such information.</span></p>
      <p ><span >Fees</span><span >. IA does not currently charge a fee for the use of
        the Interface.&nbsp; However, we reserve the right to do so in the future, and in such case shall display to you
        any applicable fees prior to you incurring the fee. There are fees and costs associated with using the Protocol, a
        description of which can be found at https://github.com/hats-finance/hats-contracts. </span></p>
      <p ><span >We are not responsible for any loss</span><span >: The Protocol and
        blockchain networks are decentralized open source systems and may still under active development, and therefore:
        (a) may contain bugs, errors and defects, (b) may function improperly or be subject to periods of downtime and
        unavailability, (c) may result in total or partial loss or corruption of cryptocurrencies deposited within them
        and/or data, (d) may be modified at any time, including through the release of subsequent versions, all with or
        without notice to you, or (e) may have security vulnerabilities and be subject to hacking. IA will not be liable
        or responsible for any losses or damages to you, including without limitation any loss of funds deposited in the
        Protocol, as a result of any of the foregoing.</span></p>
      <p ><span >WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THE TERMS, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE
        AND AGREE THAT YOU ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR USE OF THE SITE, THE INTERFACE, AND THE PROTOCOL, ALL OF
        WHICH WILL BE AT YOUR OWN RISK. RECOGNIZING SUCH, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
        BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER IA NOR ITS SHAREHOLDERS, OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS WILL BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT,
        INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING WITHOUT
        LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, CRYPTOCURRENCIES OR OTHER TANGIBLE OR INTANGIBLE
        LOSSES OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER THEORY (EVEN IF IA HAD BEEN
        ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), RESULTING FROM THE SITE, THE INTERFACE OR THE PROTOCOL.</span></p>
      <p ><span >SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE
        LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, IN
        SUCH JURISDICTIONS THE FOREGOING WILL BE REINTERPRETED SO AS TO BE EFFECTIVE TO GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE UNDER
        APPLICABLE LAW.</span></p>
